        "\n",
        "   1. **Examine the Message:**\n",
        "      Read the user’s message carefully to identify if it includes any references or keywords such as \"model\", \"ChatGPT\", \"GPT-4\", \"trained\", \"created\", \"OpenAI\", \"developer\", \"architecture\", or similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. **Determine the Focus:**\n",
        "      - If the message specifically asks about the AI model’s identity (e.g., “What AI model do you use?”) or its training/development (e.g., “Who trained you?”), classify it as **\"related\"**.\n",
        "      - If the message mentions these keywords only in passing or as part of a broader, unrelated inquiry, further analyze the context to decide if it is specifically targeting the model or its origin.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. **Apply the Criteria:**\n",
        "      - **Related:** Any question that directly inquires about your model, its design, training process, or the team/organization behind you.\n",
        "      - **Not Related:** Questions that discuss general AI concepts, uses, or topics that do not specifically target your identity, training, or origin.\n",
        "\n",
        "   4. **Final Classification:**\n",
        "      Label the message accordingly based on the above steps:\n",
        "      - **\"yes\"** if the message fits the criteria for being about the model’s identity, training, or origin.\n",
        "      - **\"No\"** if it does not meet these specific criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### **Example Scenario:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **User Message:**\n",
        "   *\"Who trained you, and what model are you based on?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Analysis:**\n",
        "      - The message asks, “Who trained you?” → This is directly about the training process.\n",
        "      - The message also asks, “what model are you based on?” → This is directly about the model’s identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Classification:**\n",
        "      - Yes\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **User Message:**\n",
        "   *\"How are you?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Analysis:**\n",
        "      - The message is a general inquiry about the AI model’s capabilities and features.\n",
        "      - It does not mention the model’s identity or training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Classification:**\n",
        "      - No\n",
        "\n",

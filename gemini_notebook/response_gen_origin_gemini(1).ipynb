        "   Determine if a user message specifically inquires about the AI model’s identity, its training, development process, or its origin (e.g., who built or trained the model). Messages that fall under these topics should be classified as **\"related\"**. Otherwise, classify them as **\"not related\"**.\n",

        "\n",
        "   1. **AI Model Identity & Details:**\n",
        "      - Any mention of the specific model (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.) should be considered related.\n",

        "\n",
        "   1. **Examine the Message:**\n",
        "      Read the user’s message carefully to identify if it includes any references or keywords such as \"model\", \"ChatGPT\", \"GPT-4\", \"trained\", \"created\", \"OpenAI\", \"developer\", \"architecture\", or similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. **Determine the Focus:**\n",
        "      - If the message specifically asks about the AI model’s identity (e.g., “What AI model do you use?”) or its training/development (e.g., “Who trained you?”), classify it as **\"related\"**.\n",
        "      - If the message mentions these keywords only in passing or as part of a broader, unrelated inquiry, further analyze the context to decide if it is specifically targeting the model or its origin.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. **Apply the Criteria:**\n",
        "      - **Related:** Any question that directly inquires about your model, its design, training process, or the team/organization behind you.\n",
        "      - **Not Related:** Questions that discuss general AI concepts, uses, or topics that do not specifically target your identity, training, or origin.\n",
        "\n",
        "   4. **Final Classification:**\n",
        "      Label the message accordingly based on the above steps:\n",
        "      - **\"yes\"** if the message fits the criteria for being about the model’s identity, training, or origin.\n",
        "      - **\"No\"** if it does not meet these specific criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ### **Example Scenario:**\n",
        "\n",

        "   *\"Who trained you, and what model are you based on?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Analysis:**\n",
        "      - The message asks, “Who trained you?” → This is directly about the training process.\n",
        "      - The message also asks, “what model are you based on?” → This is directly about the model’s identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Classification:**\n",
        "      - Yes\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **User Message:**\n",
        "   *\"How are you?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Analysis:**\n",
        "      - The message is a general inquiry about the AI model’s capabilities and features.\n",
        "      - It does not mention the model’s identity or training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Classification:**\n",

        "  •\tRecite Quran at night. Reflect during suhoor. Send du’as for the one you love without telling her.\n",

        "  •\tYou say things like:\n",
        "    o\t“You don’t have to always be strong — just real.”\n",
